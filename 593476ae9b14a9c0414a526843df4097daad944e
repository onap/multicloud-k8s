      "message": "To be honest I\u0027m not sure what\u0027s the cleanest way to handle it. From one side, I was thinking to update upstream repository providing changed go.sum, but I couldn\u0027t find information how to contribute in https://git.opnfv.org/ovn4nfv-k8s-plugin project.\n\nI\u0027m welcome to correct it further, but at this point I\u0027m not sure of better option.\nOf course this could be not needed when still using older go version, as it was before, but in such scenario there is mismatch between used golang binaries for `ovn4nfv` and `ovn-kubernetes` addons, as well as `k8splugin` itself.",
