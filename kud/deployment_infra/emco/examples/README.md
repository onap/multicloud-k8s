# Installing KUD addons with emcoctl

This folder contains KUD addons to deploy with EMCO. The example
configuration assumes one edge cluster to deploy to. EMCO needs to be
installed on the cluster before deploying these addons and emcoctl
needs to be installed and configured for the edge cluster.

1. Multus CNI
2. OVN4NFV K8s Plugin
3. Node Feature Discovery
4. SR-IOV Network Operator
5. SR-IOV Network
6. QuickAssist Technology (QAT) Device Plugin
7. CPU Manager for Kubernetes

## Setup environment to deploy addons

1. Export environment variables
   - KUBE_PATH: where the kubeconfig for edge cluster is located, and
   - HOST_IP: IP address of the cluster where EMCO is installed.

#### NOTE: For HOST_IP, assuming here that nodeports are used to access all EMCO services both from outside and between the EMCO services.

2. Customize values.yaml.

    `$ envsubst < values.yaml.example > values.yaml`
    `$ envsubst < values-resources.yaml.example > values-resources.yaml`

## Create prerequisites to deploy addons

Apply prerequisites.yaml. This creates controllers, one project, one
cluster, and default logical cloud. This step is required to be done
only once.

    `$ emcoctl apply -f prerequisites.yaml -v values.yaml`

## Deploying addons

Apply composite-app.yaml. This deploys the addons listed in the `Apps`
value.

    `$ emcoctl apply -f ../output/composite-app.yaml -v values.yaml`
    `$ emcoctl apply -f ../output/composite-app.yaml -v values-resources.yaml`

## Cleanup

1. Delete addons.

    `$ emcoctl delete -f ../output/composite-app.yaml -v values-resources.yaml`
    `$ emcoctl delete -f ../output/composite-app.yaml -v values.yaml`

2. Cleanup prerequisites.

    `$ emcoctl delete -f prerequisites.yaml -v values.yaml`

#### NOTE: Known issue: Deletion of the resources fails sometimes as some resources can't be deleted before others are deleted. This can happen due to timing issue. In that case try deleting again and the deletion should succeed.
