# The mitogen module used in kubespray requires python2 on the nodes.
# On some distributions (i.e. Ubuntu 18.04), the default version of
# python is python3.
#
# When python2 is not present a failure message similar to "bash:
# /usr/bin/python: No such file or directory" will be reported.
#
# Note the use of "strategy: linear" below to temporarily bypass
# mitogen.
