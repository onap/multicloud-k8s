# The following is done this way as each patch on CI runs build and each merge runs deploy. So for build we don't need to build binary and hence
# no need to create a static binary with additional flags. However, for generating binary, additional build flags are necessary. This if used with
# mock plugin errors out for unit tests. So the seperation avoids the error.
